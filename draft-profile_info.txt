Sea-ice drafts series------------------------------------------------------------D. B. Percival, D. A. Rothrock, A. S. Thorndike and T. Gneiting(2008), The Variance of Mean Sea-Ice Thickness: Effect of Long-RangeDependence, Journal of Geophysical Research - Oceans, 113, C01004,doi:10.1029/2007JC004391.Percival et al. (2008) investigate whether sea-ice drafts series (asurrogate for ice thickness) exhibit long range dependence, whenviewed as a function of distance. They consider data taken from twoSCientfic ICe EXpedition (SCICEX) cruises within the Arctic Ocean(Original source: the Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado,USA).The dataset we use in this article was downloaded fromhttp://staff.washington.edu/dbp/DATA/draft-profile.txt.
